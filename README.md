# Neilblaze | Pratyay Banerjee
Hi 👋, I'm Pratyay. I am a passionate software developer trying to build solutions to the world’s problems. I am a spohomore in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Deeply passionate about web, OSS and tech in general. Whether that be through creating neural networks or building web applications, all my work is focused on one thing: impact. When I'm not coding, you can find me sketching, doing CP, or playing soccer! The love for new skills and desire to create something which can directly influence people, keeps me interested. 🚀

- 🔭 I’m currently working on React ~ Nuxt projects
- 👨‍💻 Competitive programming: [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/zack_007) | [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/N3ilz_BL4Z3)  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gatsby
- 👨 I’m looking to collaborate on Projects and Hackathons
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Open Source and CP
- 💬 Ask me about anything
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a quizzer & Rubik's lover :D
- 🏃 Hobbies: Skectching and playing CSGO 🎮

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 🧠
